        <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Leonardo Reis</strong>. I’m a 25-year-old web development enthusiast originally from the vibrant country of Brazil, now calling the sunny state of Florida my home.</p>
        <p>Currently, I’m diving deep into the world of web development, sharpening my skills in creating modern, responsive, and user-friendly websites and applications. My journey into web development has been fueled by a strong passion for technology and a constant desire to learn and grow in this ever-evolving field.</p>
        <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me indulging in one of my favorite pastimes: playing video games. I believe that gaming not only offers a great way to unwind but also inspires creativity and problem-solving skills, which I love bringing into my development projects.</p>
        <p>I’m excited about the opportunities ahead and eager to contribute my growing expertise to innovative projects. Let's connect and see how I can help bring your ideas to life!</p>
